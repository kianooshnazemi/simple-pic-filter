# simple-pic-filter
there's an educational beginner project which I coded in my first year at Shahrekord university.
It's my first repository on github.I coded this one for Dr. Khayyam Salehi's lesson project.
all you need is running filterMain.py in terminal and add your picture as sis.argv[1] then it works like baghlava.
